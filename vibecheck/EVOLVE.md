# Workflow Evolution Log

- [quality bar] Verifies claims about what's built. When told "this scans globally" he tested it and pushed back — "I'm skeptical." Expects the AI to be honest about what's actually implemented vs. planned. Don't conflate a plan with shipped code.
- [process] Provides detailed implementation plans with resolved design decisions before coding starts. Expects the AI to execute the plan faithfully, step-by-step, not re-debate the design.
- [quality bar] Wants build verification after implementation, not just "it looks right." Expects `npm run build` to pass before considering work done.
- [communication] Asks sharp, specific follow-up questions (e.g., "what's the terminal command?") — prefers actionable answers over explanations.
