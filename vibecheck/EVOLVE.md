# Workflow Evolution Log

- [process] Provides detailed implementation plans with resolved design decisions before coding starts. Expects the AI to execute the plan faithfully, step-by-step, not re-debate the design.
- [quality bar] Wants build verification after implementation, not just "it looks right." Expects `npm run build` to pass before considering work done.
- [communication] Asks sharp, specific follow-up questions (e.g., "what's the terminal command?") — prefers actionable answers over explanations.
